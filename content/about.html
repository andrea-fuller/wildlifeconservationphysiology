<p>By improving our understanding of how free-living mammals function, the Wildlife Conservation Physiology team at the <a href="https://www.wits.ac.za/">University of the Witwatersrand</a> aims to contribute to informed conservation and management of arid-zone mammals.</p>
<p>We have two main research themes:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>to understand the physiological plasticity available to free-living mammals to cope with climate change,</p></li>
<li><p>to improve the physiological welfare of mammals during conservation management practices, such as immobilization and translocation.</p></li>
</ol>
