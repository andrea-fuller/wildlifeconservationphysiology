By improving our understanding of how free-living mammals function, the Wildlife Conservation Physiology team at the [University of the Witwatersrand](https://www.wits.ac.za/) aims to contribute to informed conservation and management of arid-zone mammals.

We have two main research themes: 

1. to understand the physiological plasticity available to free-living mammals to cope with climate change,

2. to improve the physiological welfare of mammals during conservation management practices, such as immobilization and translocation.
